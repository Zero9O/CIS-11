3.1.11 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4

1. Using the value –35, write it as an integer literal in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary formats that are consistent with MASM syntax.
  Decimal: -35d
  Hexadecimal: FFFF FFDDh
  Octal: 37 777 777 735o
  Binary: 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101 1101b

2. (Yes/No): Is A5h a valid hexadecimal literal? 
  No
  
3. (Yes/No): Does the multiplication operator (*) have a higher precedence than the division operator (/) in integer expressions? 
  No

4. Create a single integer expression that uses all the operators from Section 3.1.2. Calculate the value of the expression
  -3 MOD 5 * (4 - 5) / (1 + 2) = -3 MOD 5 * -1 / 3 = -3 * -1 / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1

4. In the AddTwo program, which register holds the sum?
  eax

5. In the AddTwo program, which statement halts the program?
  INVOKE ExitProcess,0 



3.3.3 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4

1. What types of ﬁles are produced by the assembler? 
  Object Files

2. (True/False): The linker extracts assembled procedures from the link library and inserts them in the executable program. 
  True

3. (True/False): When a program’s source code is modiﬁed, it must be assembled and linked again before it can be executed with the changes. 
  True

4. Which operating system component reads and executes programs?
  Loader




3.4.13 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

1. Create an uninitialized data declaration for a 16-bit signed integer. 
  var1 SWORD ?

2. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit unsigned integer. 
  var2 BYTE ?

3. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit signed integer.
  var3 SBYTE ?

4. Create an uninitialized data declaration for a 64-bit integer. 
  var4 QWORD ?

5. Which data type can hold a 32-bit signed integer?
  SDWORD




3.5.5 Section Review Question 3

3. Write a statement that causes the assembler to calculate the number of bytes in the following array, and assign the value to a symbolic constant named ArraySize:
  myArray WORD 20 DUP(?)
  ArraySize = ($ - myArray)



3.9.1 Short Answer, Questions 4, 5, 6, 25

4. Explain why the term assembler language is not quite correct. 
  Assembler is the process of converting assembly language into machine code.

5. Explain the difference between big endian and little endian. Also, look up the origins of this term on the Web. 
  Big endian orders data from high to low while little-endian orders data from low to high.

6. Why might you use a symbolic constant rather than an integer literal in your code? 
  Symbolic constants don't reserve storage and if a symbolic constant is used multiple times in a program all you have to do is redefine it's value and it affects every instance of it making programs easier to read and maintain.

25. Which data directive creates a 32-bit signed integer variable? 
  SDWORD




3.9.2 Algorithm Workbench, Questions 4, 7, 13

4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking? 
  It doesn't type check.
  
7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values. 
  .data?
  anArray DWORD 120 DUP(?)

13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.
  .data
  sArray BYTE 500 DUP("TEST")
