1.1.3 Section Review 

1.How do assemblers and linkers work together? 
Assemblers convert source code programs from assembly language into machine language and linkers take those files and combine them into a single executable program. 

3. What is meant by one-to-many relationship when comparing a high-level language to machine language? 
One-to-many relationship means that a single statement from a high-level language expands into multiple assembly language or machine instructions. 

8. Do you suppose type checking on pointer variables is stronger (stricter) in assembly language, or in C or C++? 
Type checking is stronger in C or C++ because they use syntax rules to reduce unintended logic errors. 

12. Challenge: Translate the following C++ expression to assembly language, using the example presented earlier in this chapter as a guide: X = (Y * 4) + 3. 
mov eax, Y 
mov ebx 4 
imul ebx 
add eax, 3
mov X,eax

2. Why do you suppose translated programs often execute more quickly than interpreted ones? 


3. (True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each of its instructions is decoded and executed by a program written in Language L0. 

10. Statements at the assembly language level of a virtual machine are translated into statements at which other level?
